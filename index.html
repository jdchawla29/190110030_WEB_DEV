<li>Listing common actions as my hobbies</li>
</ol>
<li>My ambitions and goals in life; <i>(inspired by the great Hachiman Hikigaya)</i>listed as follow:</li>
<ol>
<li>“If wishes could be granted, if desires could be fulfilled, then I wouldn’t wish or desire for anything after all. The things you’re handed on a silver platter are never genuine, and never everlasting. And that is why I’ll always keep searching.” </li>
<li>To become Hokage, <i>dattebayo</i></li>
